## User journey

A user is trying to read their book for a class assignment. Unfortunately, they get distracted when reading and often have to reread pages multiple times, wasting time and effort.

They search for ways to maintain their focus while reading and discover the concept of active reading. They find our app, QuizRead, and log in. They see the option to upload a digital version of their book, so they do so. They are prompted with some form fields as to how long they want their timed reading sessions and breaks to be, with the recommended choices of 25 minutes of reading time and 5 minutes of break time already filled out.

As they’re reading, they can see a time tracker of when their session will be over as well as a pause and play button if they need to stop reading during the session for some reason. After reading every 2 pages, a quiz comes up about those pages. The user has to select one of the four answers, and after submitting, they receive feedback about their answer.

After reading every 3 pages, an annotation prompt comes up asking the user to write down key ideas they just read about. Once the user is done typing their annotation, they can click submit, and the annotation will be saved.

Once the timer for the user’s current session runs out, they’ll be taken to a break page where a timer will show how long they have for their break. If the user feels as if they’re done reading now, they can also exit to the home page.
